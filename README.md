# Project Title

AI-powered coaching system for basketball (WeBall)

## Description

The AI-powered coaching system for basketball, known as the WeBall app, revolutionizes personalized training in basketball. Designed to enhance dribbling and shooting skills, the app offers an accessible and engaging solution for individuals seeking to improve their performance. By leveraging cutting-edge technologies such as computer vision and artificial intelligence, WeBall creates a game-like environment that analyzes user performance and provides personalized feedback. 

During dribbling mode, the app utilizes advanced computer vision algorithms to detect body motion and the basketball, creating an interactive experience. Users are challenged to dribble the ball while playing a game. In shooting mode, the software employs basketball rim detection to accurately track missed and scored shots, allowing users to gauge their accuracy and progress. 

The WeBall app is designed to run on any hardware equipped with a camera, making it easily accessible for individual training sessions. Users can receive an objective assessment of their performance by providing detailed performance metrics such as field goal (FG) percentage and dribbling accuracy. The app also offers personalized feedback based on user performance analysis, enabling individuals to fine-tune their skills and elevate their basketball proficiency. 

With its focus on dribbling and shooting skills, the WeBall app fills a crucial gap in the market for affordable and efficient basketball training. Merging technology, interactivity, and personalized coaching empowers users to train effectively and enhance their basketball abilities. Whether novice or experienced, the WeBall app offers a convenient and engaging platform for individuals to sharpen their skills and achieve their goals on the court.
